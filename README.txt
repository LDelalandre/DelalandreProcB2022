To perform the analysis:

\Final
* 1.Distinctiveness computation_command files.R
i) Computes the distinctiveness of all the species. Writes it in a .txt file.
ii) Writes the command files for the four sites, removing species in increasing, decreasing, and random order of distinctiveness.
NB: seeds are set from 1 to 10 for the ten random orders generated.

* 2.Process_data.R



\R
* Before simulations.R 
1. Computes the distinctiveness of all the species. Writes it in a .txt file.
2. Writes the command files for the four sites, removing species in increasing, decreasing, and random order of distinctiveness.

* Analysis_data.R

* Monocultures_functions.R
