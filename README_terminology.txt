- Regional pool of species: the 30 species, or a subset of them.

For a given regional pool;
- Local pool (in a site): Species that grow in monoculture.
- Realized pool (in a site): Species that grow in mixture (and whose biomass is above 0.01% times the total biomass in the community
during the last year of the simulation).


Site: Name of one of the 11 sites.
Order: species ranking used for a simulation (e.g. species ranked from the most to the least functionally distinct).
Simul, or number: the number of the simulation in a given site and for a given order. From 1 (all  the 30 species) to 30 (the last species of the given order).
