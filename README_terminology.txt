- Regional pool of species: the 30 species, or a subset of them.

For a given regional pool;
- Local pool (in a site): Species that grow in monoculture (use a biomass threshold or not? Anyway, I don't analyse it.)
- Realized pool (in a site): Species that grow in mixture (and whose biomass is above 0.01% times the total biomass in the community
during the last year of the simulation).
